		<h3>
		  <ul><br><br>
		    <li>Computer is an electronic machine which is used for data processing and manipulation.<br><br></li>
		    <li>When programmer collects such type of data for processing, he would require to store 
				all of them in computer's main memory.<br><br></li>
			<li>In order to make computer work we need to know :<br></li>
			    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Representation of data in computer.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Accessing of data.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-How to solve problem step by step.<br><br>
			<li>For doing this task we use Data Structure.</li><br><br>
		  
		    <li>In the modern world, Data and its information is an essential part, and various implementations are
		        being made to store in different ways. </li><br><br>
			<li>Data are just a collection of facts and figures, or you can say data are values or set of values 
			    that are in a particular format. </li><br><br>
			<li>A data item refers to a single set of values.</li><br><br>
			<li> Data items are then further categorized into sub-items which are the group of items which are not
       			being called a <em>plain elementary form </em>of items.</li><br><br>
		        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take an example where the name of the student may be divided into three
		        sub-items namely: <em>first name, middle name and last name. </em><br>
		        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ID that is assigned to a student would normally be considered as a single item.<br><br>

		        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the example mentioned above such as ID, Age, Gender, First, Middle, Last, Street, Area, 
				etc. are elementary data items, whereas (Name, Address) is group data items.
