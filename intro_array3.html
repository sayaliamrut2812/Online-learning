<h2>Sparse Matrices</h2>
	<p>A matrix is a two-dimensional data object made of m rows and
	n columns, therefore having total m x n values. 
	If most of the elements of the matrix have 0 value, then it is called a<u> sparse matrix.</u><br>
	Sparse_Marix Create(max_row, max_col) ::=                              
	return a Sparse_matrix that can hold up to                               
	max_items = max _row ï‚´ max_col and                                 
	whose maximum row size is max_row and                                
	whose maximum  column size is max_col.

	<h2>Sparse Matrix Representation</h2>
	<p>
	1)	Represented by a two-dimensional array.
     	Sparse matrix wastes space.<br>
(2)	Each element is characterized by <b>(row, col, value).</b><br>
The terms in A should be ordered
based on <b>(row, col)</b>
